Assignment 7 
Problem:  Write a script that suggests what clothing to wear based on the 
current temperature The program should use if...else or if...else if statements to 
determine the suggestion.  
Instructions: 1. Create a new file named weather.js. Inside the file, declare a 
variable to store the temperature,  
for example: let temperature = 28;  
2. Use if...else or if...else if statements to decide and print the clothing 
suggestion based on the temperature 
3. Use the following logic for clothing suggestion:  
If temperature is above 35°C Print: wear light cotton clothes  
◦ If temperature is between 20°C and 35°C Pint: Normal casual wear  
○ If temperature is between 10°C and 19°C Print: Wear a jacket  
○ If temperature is below 10°C Print: stay indoors, it's too cold! Run the script 
using: node weather.js  
Test Cases to Try: • temperature = 40 • temperature = 28 . temperature- 15

let temperature = 40;
if (temperature>=35){
    console.log("wear light cotton cloths");
}else if(temperature>=20 && temperature<=35){
    console.log("Normal casual wear");
} else if(temperature>=10 && temperature<=19){
    console.log("wear a jacket");
}else if(temperature<10){
    console.log("stay indoor its too cold");
